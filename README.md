## What is Hack Night?

We are a local Long Beach Tech meetup. We welcome people of any technical competency. If you are a Luddite or a master hacker, all are welcome and encouraged to join in our discussions. Come join us every Tuesday for a chance to network and learn. We are part of the non-profit group [Uncoded](http://www.uncoded.org/).

## Where We Meet

We have been meeting at [Rebel Bite](http://rebelbite.com/main/) for over a year now and it's become our unofficial home. Our meetup happens at the same time that Rebel Bite starts their Happy Hour and select food and beverages are discounted. Take advantage of the delicious grub!
